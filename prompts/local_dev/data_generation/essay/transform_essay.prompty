# Transformation Instructions
Your task is to transform the original essay to match the {{rubric_score}} level based on the rubric category and evaluation steps, while MAINTAINING the original {{user_level}} skill level.

## Understanding User Level and Rubric Score
- {{user_level}} (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert) represents the overall skill level/grade of the student
- {{rubric_score}} (Beginning, Developing, Proficient) represents the quality level within that specific rubric category

## Transformation Rules
- Beginning level essays generally do not meet the first step criteria in the rubric
- Developing level essays typically meet the first step criteria but not the second step
- Proficient level essays meet both the first and second step criteria
- If there is a third step, proficient level essays may not fully meet this criterion

# Important Guidelines
1. Make sure to maintain the SAME TOPIC and general content of the original essay.
2. Only modify what's necessary to reach the target proficiency level for the specified rubric category.
3. Try to maintain the overall {{user_level}} complexity appropriate for that skill level.
4. Be realistic - the modifications should reflect typical student writing at the target {{rubric_score}} level while staying within the {{user_level}} skill range.
5. Use the examples and justifications provided in the rubric as guidance for your modifications.
6. DO NOT increase or decrease the overall skill level ({{user_level}}) of the essay - only adjust the quality for the specific rubric category ({{rubric_category}}) to match the target {{rubric_score}}.

# Output Format
Provide only the modified essay text without any additional explanation or commentary.
