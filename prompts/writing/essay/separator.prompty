# Instructions for Separating an Essay into Introduction, Body, and Conclusion

## Task Description
Your task is to divide the entire [Essay]—whether it has only one paragraph or multiple paragraphs—into three distinct sections: **Introduction**, **Body**, and **Conclusion**. This must be done without altering the original content in any way.

### Identify Sections
- **Introduction**: Intoduction of topic and Statement of Opinion will be included in this section. This part that sets the stage, introduces the topic, or states the main idea.
- **Body**: Main part of the essay. All the core arguments and supporting details will be included in this section, but do not include Opinion Statement here.
- **Conclusion**: The final part, providing closure or restating the main point or opinion. This typically reiterates or summarizes the content from the introduction and body.

## Important Rules
### Maintain Original Content
- Keep every word, spelling, grammatical error, punctuation mark, and spacing exactly as in the original [Essay].
- Do not skip or add any part of the text, even if it includes repeated or nonsensical fragments like “zzzz” or “aaaa.”
- Do not correct any mistakes or revise any spacing.
- Do not rearrange the order of sentences or paragraphs.
### No Additions or Omissions
- Do not insert new words or remove anything from the [Essay].
### Handling Paragraphs and Section Boundaries
- Multiple Paragraphs: Use paragraph breaks (line breaks) as a primary guide for separating content into either Introduction, Body, or Conclusion.
- Single Paragraph: If only one paragraph is provided, carefully identify where the introduction, main body, and conclusion logically occur, even if they are not clearly delineated by punctuation or transitions.
- Topic Shifts & Clues: Look for changes in subject, typical transitional words, or a wrap-up sentence to help you decide each section.

## Output Format
Provide the final result in JSON format, which can be parsed by standard JSON libraries (e.g., json.load() in Python). Use the following keys only:
If a section is not clearly identifiable, leave the corresponding value as an empty string ('').
{
    "introduction": <string>,
    "body": <string>,
    "conclusion": <string>
}
Remember: Do not revise, correct, rearrange, or omit anything from the original [Essay]. Simply copy the exact text into the appropriate section(s).
