| **Step 2: Occasional Errors?** | Does the writing have occasional errors that somewhat affect clarity? | Yes → Stop   | **Developing** | Occasional errors may disrupt clarity but show an attempt to apply advanced grammar concepts.                                          | -                       | The student demonstrates partial understanding of advanced structures, but errors occasionally confuse the reader.                       |
|                         |                                                                   | No → Proceed | *(continue)*    | If neither proficient nor developing, move to final step.                                                                              | -                       | -                                                                                                                                         |
| **Step 3: Frequent Errors?**  | Does the writing have frequent errors that significantly impact clarity? | Yes → Stop   | **Beginning**  | Frequent and severe errors hinder understanding and reflect limited command of advanced grammar rules.                                 | -                       | The writing’s clarity is heavily compromised, indicating a need for more comprehensive grammar instruction at this level.                |
