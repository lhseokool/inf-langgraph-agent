| **Step 1: Few Errors?** | Does the writing have few errors with minimal impact on clarity?  | Yes → Stop   | **Proficient**  | Few errors that do not obscure meaning demonstrate proficiency in grammar at the Basic level.                                          | *(Refer to Grammar)*    | The presence of only a few minor errors means the student can apply basic grammar rules effectively without significantly hindering understanding. |
|                         |                                                                   | No → Proceed | *(continue)*    | If not, check the next level of severity for errors.                                                                                  | -                       | -                                                                                                                                     |
| **Step 2: Occasional Errors?** | Does the writing have occasional errors that somewhat affect clarity? | Yes → Stop   | **Developing** | Occasional errors may cause slight disruption to clarity but show some understanding of grammar rules.                                  | -                       | The student attempts to use grammar rules, but errors occasionally disrupt readability or clarity.                                    |
|                         |                                                                   | No → Proceed | *(continue)*    | If still not met, move to the final step.                                                                                             | -                       | -                                                                                                                                     |
| **Step 3: Frequent Errors?**  | Does the writing have frequent errors that significantly impact clarity? | Yes → Stop   | **Beginning**  | Frequent and severe errors hinder understanding and reflect limited command of grammar rules.                                          | -                       | The writing is often unclear due to grammar mistakes, indicating a need for more focused instruction.                                |
