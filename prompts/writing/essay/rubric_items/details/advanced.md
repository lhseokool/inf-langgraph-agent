| **Step 1: Presence Check**  | Does the writing provide evidence or examples to support the claim?      | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | Evidence or examples are missing, unclear, or irrelevant, leaving the claim unsupported.                                                             | **Claim**: "Recess is essential for students."<br/>**Reason**: "Recess helps students recharge."<br/>**Detail**: "Students love recess."         | The statement “Students love recess” doesn’t address *how* or *why* recess helps students recharge, thus failing to support the claim effectively. |
|                             |                                                                         | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | Evidence or examples are present, so move to the next step.                                                                                          | -                                                                                                                                                                    | -                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check**   | Is the evidence clear and relevant to the reason?                         | No → Stop      | **Developing** | Evidence is present but lacks clarity, depth, or relevance to the claim or reason.                                                                    | **Claim**: "Recess is essential for students."<br/>**Reason**: "Recess helps students recharge."<br/>**Detail**: "Kids like playing tag during recess." | While tag is a recess activity, it doesn’t explicitly connect to why recess helps students *recharge*, thus lacking clarity or depth.           |
|                             |                                                                         | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | The evidence is clear, relevant, and directly supports the claim and reason.                                                                         | **Claim**: "Recess is essential for students."<br/>**Reason**: "Recess helps students recharge."<br/>**Detail**: "Research shows that students who take breaks during the school day have better focus in class." | The detail references research findings, providing a clear, credible link between breaks (recess) and improved focus, thereby supporting the claim. |
