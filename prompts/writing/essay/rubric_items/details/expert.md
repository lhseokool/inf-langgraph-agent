| **Step 1: Presence Check**        | Does the writing provide detailed and credible evidence to support the claim?        | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | Evidence is missing, insufficient, or irrelevant, leaving the claim unsupported.                                                                                           | **Claim**: "Recess is vital for high school students."<br/>**Reason**: "Recess reduces stress."<br/>**Detail**: "Recess is great because students enjoy it."                | The statement “students enjoy it” does not address how or why recess reduces stress, thus failing to support the reason.            |
|                                   |                                                                                      | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | Evidence is present, so move to the next step.                                                                                                                             | -                                                                                                                                                                             | -                                                                                                                                    |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check**         | Is the evidence detailed, credible, and relevant to the claim and reasoning?         | No → Stop      | **Developing** | Evidence is present but lacks depth, credibility, or strong relevance to the claim and reasoning.                                                                          | **Claim**: "Recess is vital for high school students."<br/>**Reason**: "Recess reduces stress."<br/>**Detail**: "Recess helps students take a break from class."              | The evidence addresses the idea of a “break,” but it doesn’t specify *how* or *why* this break reduces stress, nor does it cite any credible source or data.            |
|                                   |                                                                                      | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | The evidence is detailed, credible, and clearly supports the claim and reasoning.                                                                                           | **Claim**: "Recess is vital for high school students."<br/>**Reason**: "Recess reduces stress."<br/>**Detail**: "Studies show that students who engage in unstructured breaks experience 20% lower stress levels compared to those without recess." | This example provides a credible study, specific data (20% lower stress levels), and a direct connection to the reason (stress reduction). |
