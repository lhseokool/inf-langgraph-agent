| **Step 1: Presence Check** | Does the writing provide a detail to support the reason? | No → Stop      | **Beginning** | The detail is missing or irrelevant, leaving the reason unsupported.                                                                                                      | **Opinion**: "I like recess."<br/>**Reason**: "We get to play games."<br/>**Detail**: "Recess is fun."                                                                              | The detail is simply restating an opinion ("fun") and does not add any specific or logical support to back up the reason.                           |
|                         |                                                        | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*  | A detail is provided, so move to the next step.                                                                                                                           | -                                                                                                                                                                                    | -                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check** | Is the detail clear and easy to understand?              | No → Stop      | **Developing**| The detail is present but lacks clarity or specificity, making it less effective.                                                                                         | **Opinion**: "I like recess."<br/>**Reason**: "We get to play games."<br/>**Detail**: "We can run around."                                                                          | Although relevant, it doesn’t provide enough specificity (how running around supports the idea of playing games or enjoying recess).                |
|                         |                                                        | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient**| The detail is clear, specific, and directly supports the reason.                                                                                                          | **Opinion**: "I like recess."<br/>**Reason**: "We get to play games."<br/>**Detail**: "We can run races with friends, climb on the jungle gym, and swing high into the sky."        | This detail is straightforward, relevant, and age-appropriate, showing exactly how recess games support the stated reason.                          |
