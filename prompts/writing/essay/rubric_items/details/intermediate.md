| **Step 1: Presence Check** | Does the writing provide details to support the reason? | No → Stop      | **Beginning** | Details are missing or irrelevant, leaving the reason unsupported.                                                               | **Opinion**: "I think recess is the best part of school."<br/>**Reason**: "It helps us relax after studying."<br/>**Detail**: "Recess is fun."                                | The detail “Recess is fun” is too vague and does not explain how it helps with relaxation, thus providing minimal support to the reason.            |
|                         |                                                         | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*  | A detail is provided, so move to the next step.                                                                                 | -                                                                                                                                                                            | -                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check** | Are the details clear and relevant to the reason?         | No → Stop      | **Developing**| Details are present but lack specificity, clarity, or connection to the reason.                                                 | **Opinion**: "I think recess is the best part of school."<br/>**Reason**: "It helps us relax after studying."<br/>**Detail**: "It’s when we go outside."                    | The statement about going outside is somewhat relevant to recess but doesn’t explicitly show how it leads to relaxation.                            |
|                         |                                                         | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient**| Details are clear, relevant, and directly support the reason.                                                                    | **Opinion**: "I think recess is the best part of school."<br/>**Reason**: "It helps us relax after studying."<br/>**Detail**: "Recess lets us stretch our legs and talk with friends, which helps us feel calmer after studying." | These details clarify *how* recess aids relaxation—stretching legs, socializing—all of which connect logically to the reason given.                 |
