| **Step 1: Presence Check** | Does the writing include a beginning, middle, and end? | No → Stop       | **Beginning** | Writing lacks a recognizable structure or sequence.                                                                                   | “I like cats. The weather is nice. Cars are fast.”                | The sentences are unrelated and show no logical flow, so the structure is effectively nonexistent.                                                             |
|                         |                                                          | Yes → Proceed   | *(continue)*  | Writing has some structure, so move to the next step.                                                                                 | -                                                                 | -                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check** | Are the beginning, middle, and end clear and complete?  | No → Stop       | **Developing**| The writing includes a basic structure but lacks clarity or completeness in its parts.                                                | “First, I went to the park. Then, I came home.”                   | There is a sequence (park → home), but it lacks detail or completeness in the beginning, middle, and end.                                                     |
|                         |                                                          | Yes → Stop      | **Proficient**| Writing includes a clear and complete structure with beginning, middle, and end.                                                      | “First, I went to the park. While there, I saw my friends and played games. After that, I went home.” | Each part (beginning, middle, end) is clearly defined and contributes to an overall coherent structure.                                                        |
