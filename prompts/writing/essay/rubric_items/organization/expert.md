| **Step 1: Presence Check**        | Are ideas and evidence present in a clear sequence?                                       | No → Stop     | **Beginning**| Ideas and evidence lack any sequence or logical flow.                                                                                                   | “Dogs are nice. Pizza is great. The sun is shining.”                                                                       | Even if these statements are valid in isolation, they do not create a coherent, ordered structure that builds toward an argument or thesis.                                             |
|                                   |                                                                                           | Yes → Proceed | *(continue)* | Ideas and evidence show a sequence, so move to the next step.                                                                                            | -                                                                                                                           | -                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Step 2: Logical Progression Check** | Is the sequence logically progressive and cohesive?                                          | No → Stop     | **Developing**| Organization shows a sequence, but progression is basic or lacks logical sophistication.                                                                 | “Dogs are loyal. They make good pets. Also, it’s sunny outside.”                                                            | While statements about dogs form a minimal sequence, the final statement about weather does not deepen or extend the argument, showing limited progression.                             |
|                                   |                                                                                           | Yes → Proceed | *(continue)* | The organization is logically progressive, so move to the final check.                                                                                  | -                                                                                                                           | -                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Step 3: Sophistication Check**  | Does the organization include claims, counterclaims, evidence, and analysis in a sophisticated sequence? | No → Stop     | **Developing**| Writing shows logical sequence but lacks sophisticated integration of counterclaims or analysis.                                                          | “Dogs are loyal and make great pets. Some people prefer cats, but dogs offer emotional support.”                                                                 | A basic counterclaim (cats) is acknowledged, yet deeper analysis or thorough linking to the central argument is missing, indicating only partial sophistication.                         |
|                                   |                                                                                           | Yes → Stop    | **Proficient**| Writing integrates claims, counterclaims, evidence, and analysis in a sophisticated and logical sequence.                                               | “Dogs are the best pets because they offer loyalty and companionship. While some prefer cats for independence, dogs provide unmatched emotional support.”        | This example skillfully weaves claims, counterclaims, and evidence into a cohesive argument, illustrating advanced organizational mastery.                                             |
