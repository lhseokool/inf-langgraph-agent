| **Step 1: Presence Check**    | Are claims and evidence present and organized logically?    | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | Writing lacks any logical connection or organization between claims and evidence.                                                                              | “Dogs are nice. Pizza is great. I went to the park.”                                        | While each sentence might be a ‘claim,’ there is no overarching argument or logical sequence tying these ideas together.                                                                |
|                               |                                                             | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | Claims and evidence are somewhat connected, so move to the next step.                                                                                          | -                                                                                            | -                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Step 2: Logical Connection Check** | Are claims and evidence consistently connected to support an argument? | No → Stop      | **Developing** | Claims and evidence are partially organized but lack consistency or logical connections.                                                                       | “My dog is my best friend because he’s loyal. I like pizza. It’s sunny outside.”             | There is one coherent claim (about the dog), but the rest (pizza, sunny weather) do not connect logically to form a clear argument or progression.                                     |
|                               |                                                             | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | Claims and evidence are organized logically, supporting a clear argument.                                                                                      | “My dog is my best friend because he’s loyal and always there for me. Dogs bring happiness to people.” | Both sentences center on dog loyalty and its benefits, forming a coherent argument and logical flow of ideas.                                                                           |
