| **Step 1: Presence Check** | Are ideas grouped logically to support the writer’s purpose?         | No → Stop       | **Beginning** | Ideas lack logical grouping and are scattered or unrelated.                                                                      | “I went to the park. My dog is brown. I like pizza. It was sunny.”                | The statements do not align under a single purpose, indicating no clear organizational strategy.                                               |
|                         |                                                                     | Yes → Proceed   | *(continue)*  | Some organization is present, so move to the next step.                                                                          | -                                                                                | -                                                                                                                                               |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check** | Is the organization clear and logically grouped?                      | No → Stop       | **Developing**| Ideas are grouped, but the structure is unclear or lacks logical flow.                                                           | “I like my dog. I also like my cat. I went to the park, and it was sunny.”        | Ideas are loosely grouped (pets/park), but lack a clear progression or central purpose.                                                        |
|                         |                                                                     | Yes → Stop      | **Proficient**| Writing is cohesive, with logical grouping that supports the writer’s purpose.                                                  | “I love going to the park because it's fun. My dog can run freely, and I can enjoy the sunshine.” | The ideas (dog, fun, sunshine) converge on a shared purpose—enjoyment of the park—creating a logical organizational flow.                       |
