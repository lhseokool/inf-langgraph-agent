| **Step**                | **Description**                                        | **Flow**       | **Result**    | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                 | **Examples**                                                                                                                                                                         | **Justification**                                                                                                                   |

| **Step 1: Presence Check** | Is an opinion clearly stated?                          | No → Stop      | **Beginning** | The opinion is missing or not stated clearly, leaving the reader uncertain about the writer’s stance.                                          | **Prompt**: "What is your favorite book?"<br/>**SOP**: "I read a book."                                                                                                            | The statement only describes an action (reading) and does not convey a personal stance or preference about the book.               |
|                         |                                                        | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*  | The opinion is clearly stated, so move to the next step.                                                                                       | -                                                                                                                                                                                    | -                                                                                                                                   |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check** | Is the opinion simple, clear, and understandable?       | No → Stop      | **Developing**| The opinion is vague or unclear, making it difficult for the reader to understand the writer’s stance.                                         | **Prompt**: "What is your favorite book?"<br/>**SOP**: "The book is okay."                                                                                                         | The opinion ("okay") is technically stated, but it lacks clarity or a definite positive/negative stance, leaving ambiguity.        |
|                         |                                                        | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient**| The opinion is simple, clear, and age-appropriate.                                                                                             | **Prompt**: "What is your favorite book?"<br/>**SOP**: "I liked the book. It was nice."                                                                                            | The stance is evident (“liked the book”) and sufficiently clear for a young writer (Grade 1-2 level).                              |
