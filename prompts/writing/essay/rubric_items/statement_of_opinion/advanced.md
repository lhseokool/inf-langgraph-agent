| **Step**                     | **Description**                                                     | **Flow**       | **Result**     | **Explanation**                                                                                                                               | **Examples**                                                                                                                                     | **Justification**                                                                                                                                        |

| **Step 1: Presence Check**  | Are claims clearly stated?                                          | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | Claims are missing or unclear, leaving the reader uncertain about the writer’s position.                                                     | **Prompt**: "Should schools require students to wear uniforms?"<br/>**SOP**: "Uniforms are in some schools."                                      | The statement merely notes a fact but does not take a stance for or against uniforms, leaving the writer’s position unstated.                           |
|                             |                                                                     | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | Claims are present, so move to the next step.                                                                                                 | -                                                                                                                                                 | -                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check**   | Are claims focused and specific, asserting a clear position?         | No → Stop      | **Developing** | Claims are present but lack specificity, leaving the stance open-ended.                                                                       | **Prompt**: "Should schools require students to wear uniforms?"<br/>**SOP**: "Uniforms are better for students."                                   | While there is a stance ("better for students"), the reasoning or focus is not detailed, limiting clarity and specificity.                              |
|                             |                                                                     | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | Claims are clearly stated, specific, and assert a focused position.                                                                           | **Prompt**: "Should schools require students to wear uniforms?"<br/>**SOP**: "School uniforms create a sense of equality and reduce distractions in the classroom." | The claim not only states a position in favor of uniforms but also highlights specific reasons (equality, reduced distractions), fitting G6-8 standards. |
