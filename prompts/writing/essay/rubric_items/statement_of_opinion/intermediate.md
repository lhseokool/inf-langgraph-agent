| **Step 1: Presence Check** | Is an opinion clearly stated?                     | No → Stop      | **Beginning** | The opinion is vague, unsupported, or missing.                                                             | **Prompt**: "Which pet is better, a dog or a cat?"<br/>**SOP**: "Dogs and cats are animals."                        | The statement is factual but does not express an opinion or preference.                                                                    |
|                         |                                                 | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*  | The opinion is stated, so move to the next step.                                                           | -                                                                                                                    | -                                                                                                                                           |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check** | Is the opinion clear and focused?                 | No → Stop      | **Developing**| The opinion is vague or lacks focus, leaving the reader uncertain about the stance.                        | **Prompt**: "Which pet is better, a dog or a cat?"<br/>**SOP**: "Cats are good pets."                               | A general statement that cats are “good” does not confirm a clear comparison or preference over dogs, so the stance remains ambiguous.     |
|                         |                                                 | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient**| The opinion is clearly stated and focused.                                                                 | **Prompt**: "Which pet is better, a dog or a cat?"<br/>**SOP**: "I think dogs are better than cats."                | The statement clearly compares dogs to cats and takes a definite stance, which is appropriate for Grade 3-5.                               |
