| **Step 1: Presence Check**        | Are claims clearly stated?                                                      | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | Claims are vague, unsupported, or missing.                                                                                                           | **Prompt**: "Should the voting age be lowered to 16?"<br/>**SOP**: "Voting is important."                                                                               | A true statement, but it does not establish a position on the voting age question, leaving the stance unclear.                                                                        |
|                                   |                                                                                 | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | Claims are present, so move to the next step.                                                                                                        | -                                                                                                                                                                     | -                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check**         | Are claims focused and specific, asserting a clear position?                    | No → Stop      | **Developing** | Claims are present but lack specificity, leaving the stance open-ended.                                                                              | **Prompt**: "Should the voting age be lowered to 16?"<br/>**SOP**: "16-year-olds should vote."                                                                          | The statement suggests a stance but lacks detail, reasoning, or specificity for robust argumentation.                                                                                |

| **Step 3: Counterclaim Check (Optional)** | Does the claim address counterclaims or audience concerns?                           | No → Stop      | **Proficient** | Claims are well-developed, even if counterclaims are not addressed.                                                                                  | **Prompt**: "Should the voting age be lowered to 16?"<br/>**SOP**: "Lowering the voting age to 16 would increase civic engagement and encourage youth participation in democracy." | The claim is specific, with a focused stance and clear reasoning about the benefit (civic engagement), meeting proficient-level expectations even without acknowledging counterclaims. |
|                                   |                                                                                 | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | Claims address counterclaims, showing depth and consideration of audience concerns.                                                                  | **Prompt**: "Should the voting age be lowered to 16?"<br/>**SOP**: "Although critics argue that 16-year-olds lack political maturity, studies show that civic engagement increases when young people participate early in the democratic process." | By acknowledging critics’ views and responding with evidence, the statement shows sophistication and depth, aligning with expert-level writing.                                       |
