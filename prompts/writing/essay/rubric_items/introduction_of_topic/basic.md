| **Step**                | **Description**                                 | **Flow**      | **Result**      | **Explanation**                                                                                                          | **Examples**                              | **Justification**                                                                                                                     |

| **Step 1: Presence Check** | Does the writing introduce the topic clearly?  | No → Stop     | **Beginning**   | The topic is not introduced or is unclear.                                                                              | “My book is nice.”                        | The writing mentions the topic ("book") but does not introduce it in a clear or oriented way.                                         |
|                         |                                                 | Yes → Proceed | *(continue)*    | The writing introduces the topic, so move to the next step.                                                              | -                                         | -                                                                                                                                     |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check** | Is the introduction clear and complete?         | No → Stop     | **Developing**  | The topic is introduced, but it lacks clarity or completeness.                                                           | “This is a story about a dog.”            | While the topic is mentioned, there is insufficient detail or clarity to fully orient the reader.                                     |
|                         |                                                 | Yes → Stop    | **Proficient**  | The topic is introduced clearly and completely.                                                                          | “My favorite book is about a dog who learns to be brave.” | The introduction explicitly states the core idea (a brave dog) and prepares the reader for what follows.                                |
