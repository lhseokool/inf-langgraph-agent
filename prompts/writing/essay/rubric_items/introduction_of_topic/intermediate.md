| **Step**                | **Description**                                            | **Flow**      | **Result**      | **Explanation**                                                                                                                    | **Examples**                                  | **Justification**                                                                                                                             |

| **Step 1: Presence Check** | Does the writing introduce the topic or claim clearly?     | No → Stop     | **Beginning**   | The topic is not introduced or is unclear.                                                                                        | “This is about my book.”                      | The statement is too vague to orient the reader or establish a clear topic/claim.                                                              |
|                         |                                                            | Yes → Proceed | *(continue)*    | The topic or claim is introduced in some way, so move to the next step.                                                            | -                                             | -                                                                                                                                               |
| **Step 2: Organizational Check** | Does the introduction provide some organizational structure? | No → Stop     | **Developing**  | The topic or claim is introduced, but the structure is unclear or incomplete.                                                     | “My favorite book is about animals.”          | While the topic is stated, there is no clear indication of how the discussion or argument will be organized.                                   |
|                         |                                                            | Yes → Stop    | **Proficient**  | The topic or claim is introduced with clarity and some organizational structure.                                                  | “My favorite book is about animals, and I will explain why it’s the best.” | The introduction sets a clear purpose (“why it’s the best”) and provides a basic structure for the upcoming explanation or argument.           |
