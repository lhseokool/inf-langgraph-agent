| **Step**                    | **Description**                                                     | **Flow**      | **Result**     | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                     | **Examples**                                                                                   | **Justification**                                                                                                                                               |

| **Step 1: Presence Check**  | Does the writing introduce claims clearly?                          | No → Stop     | **Beginning**  | Claims are unclear, unsupported, or missing.                                                                                                        | “Dogs are better pets.”                                                                       | The introduction does mention “dogs are better pets,” but it does not establish clarity or a purposeful direction for the argument.                              |
|                             |                                                                     | Yes → Proceed | *(continue)*   | Claims are present, so move to the next step.                                                                                                       | -                                                                                              | -                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Step 2: Logical Focus Check** | Does the introduction logically organize claims and focus on argumentation? | No → Stop     | **Developing** | Claims are introduced, but the organization or focus is inconsistent or unclear.                                                                     | “Dogs are great, and I’ll talk about why I think so.”                                         | The claim (dogs are great) is introduced, but the focus or structure for the argument is vague, leaving the reader uncertain about the direction of the essay. |
|                             |                                                                     | Yes → Stop    | **Proficient** | The topic introduces claims clearly and organizes them logically.                                                                                    | “Dogs are better than cats because they are loyal and protective. This essay will explain why they are the best pets.” | The introduction states a specific claim (dogs > cats) and outlines how the argument will proceed, creating logical focus and direction.                       |
