| **Step 1: Presence Check**     | Are claims introduced clearly?                                                             | No → Stop     | **Beginning**  | Claims are unclear, unsupported, or missing.                                                                                                                           | “Dogs are good pets.”                                                                                                                 | The statement acknowledges that dogs are pets but does not present a clear, focused claim or purpose.                                                                                 |
|                                |                                                                                            | Yes → Proceed | *(continue)*   | Claims are present, so move to the next step.                                                                                                                          | -                                                                                                                                     | -                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Step 2: Precision Check**    | Are claims organized with precision and logical progression?                                                                     | No → Stop     | **Developing** | Claims are introduced, but the organization lacks clarity or depth.                                                                                                    | “Dogs are better than cats because they are friendly.”                                                                                 | The claim is stated, but the reasoning is simplistic and lacks a clear, nuanced structure or progression (e.g., how or why friendliness matters).                                       |
|                                |                                                                                            | Yes → Proceed | *(continue)*   | Claims are organized logically, so move to the next step.                                                                                                              | -                                                                                                                                     | -                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Step 3: Counterclaim Check** | Are counterclaims introduced with reasoning and sequencing?                                                                      | No → Stop     | **Proficient** | Claims are well-developed, even if counterclaims are not included.                                                                                                      | “Dogs are better than cats because they are loyal and protective. This essay will highlight their superior companionship.”                                                | The introduction is precise and logically arranged around the central claim (dogs > cats), although it does not present a counterclaim.                                                |
|                                |                                                                                            | Yes → Stop    | **Proficient** | Claims are introduced with counterclaims, demonstrating reasoning and sophistication.                                                                                  | “Dogs are better than cats because they are loyal and protective. While cats are independent, this essay will explore why dogs provide unmatched companionship and emotional support.” | By including a nod to the opposite perspective (“cats are independent”) and offering reasoning, the introduction exhibits a more advanced level of nuance and sophistication.           |
