| **Step 1: Presence Check**   | Are linking words used to connect ideas?                       | No → Stop      | **Beginning** | Linking words are missing or ineffective, making the connections unclear.                                                       | “I like recess. It is fun.”                                   | The absence of any linking word makes the sentences feel disjointed.                                                                 |
|                           |                                                              | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*  | Linking words are present, so move to the next step.                                                                            | -                                                              | -                                                                                                                                     |
| **Step 2: Accuracy Check**   | Are linking words used correctly?                               | No → Stop      | **Developing**| Linking words are present but may be used inconsistently or incorrectly, causing awkwardness.                                    | “I like recess because it is fun also.”                       | The words because and also are placed in a way that disrupts the natural flow (“fun also” is awkward).                                |
|                           |                                                              | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient**| Linking words are used correctly to connect ideas.                                                                               | “I like recess because it is fun and we get to play games.”    | The linking words because and and are used in a correct, age-appropriate manner, clearly connecting the ideas.                        |
