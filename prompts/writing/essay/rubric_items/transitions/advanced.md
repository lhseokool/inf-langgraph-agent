| **Step 1: Presence Check**    | Are transitions used to connect claims, reasons, and evidence?         | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | Transitions are missing or ineffective, making relationships between ideas unclear.                                                            | “Recess helps students recharge. It is good for focus.”                                                                            | The two statements are correct, but without transitions, the relationship between recharging and focus is unclear.                                                |
|                            |                                                                      | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | Transitions are present, so move to the next step.                                                                                             | -                                                                                                                                   | -                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Step 2: Cohesion Check**    | Do the transitions clarify relationships between claims, reasons, and evidence? | No → Stop      | **Developing** | Transitions are present but may be mechanical or lack consistency, not creating a fully cohesive argument.                                     | “Recess helps students recharge. For example, they get a break. Also, it is good for focus.”                                       | While transitions exist (For example, Also), they feel repetitive and don’t smoothly connect the ideas in a logical flow.                                          |
|                            |                                                                      | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | Transitions are used effectively to clarify relationships and create cohesion.                                                                 | “Recess helps students recharge. **For instance**, students return to class more focused and ready to learn.”                     | Using for instance clearly links the example to the claim, forming a cohesive argument about the benefits of recess.                                             |
