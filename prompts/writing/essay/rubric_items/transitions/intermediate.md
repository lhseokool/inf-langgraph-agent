| **Step 1: Presence Check**   | Are linking words or phrases used to connect ideas?           | No → Stop      | **Beginning** | Few or no linking words are used, making connections unclear.                                                                                 | “Recess is the best part of school. We can play outside.”                                                         | The abrupt transition between sentences creates a disconnected reading experience.                                                          |
|                           |                                                             | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*  | Linking words or phrases are present, so move to the next step.                                                                               | -                                                                                                                 | -                                                                                                                                           |
| **Step 2: Variety Check**   | Are a range of linking words or phrases used?                   | No → Stop      | **Developing**| Linking words are used but may be overly simple or inconsistently applied.                                                                     | “Recess is the best part of school because we can play outside. Also, it’s fun.”                                 | The presence of because and also shows some attempt at transitions but lacks variety, feeling repetitive.                                  |
|                           |                                                             | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient**| A range of linking words and phrases are used to create smoother connections.                                                                 | “Recess is the best part of school **because** we can play outside. **In addition**, it helps us relax after studying.” | The transitions because and in addition demonstrate varied and smoother connections, appropriate for Grade 3-5.                            |
