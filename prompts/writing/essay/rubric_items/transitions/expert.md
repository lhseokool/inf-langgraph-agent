| **Step 1: Presence Check**        | Are transitions used to connect claims, reasons, and evidence?         | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | Transitions are missing or repetitive, making relationships unclear or monotonous.                                                                  | “Recess helps students recharge. Breaks are good for students. Research says they improve focus.”                                                     | The three statements are isolated facts or assertions with no connecting transitions, creating a disjointed flow.                                   |
|                                   |                                                                        | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | Transitions are present, so move to the next step.                                                                                                 | -                                                                                                                                          | -                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Step 2: Sophistication Check**  | Are transitions varied and reflective of the complexity of the argument? | No → Stop      | **Developing** | Transitions are present but lack sophistication or variety, making the flow feel mechanical.                                                        | “Recess helps students recharge. **For example**, students get a break. **Also**, research shows that breaks improve focus.”                        | Using for example and also shows minimal variety. The structure feels repetitive, not reflecting a nuanced or complex argument.                     |
|                                   |                                                                        | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | Transitions are varied and reflective of the complexity of the argument.                                                                           | “Recess helps students recharge; **for instance**, research shows that breaks enhance focus. **Moreover**, unstructured play improves mental well-being.” | The transitions for instance and moreover produce a fluid, logical progression suitable for a more sophisticated argument.                          |
