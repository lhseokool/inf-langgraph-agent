| **Step 1: Tone Suitability Check**  | Is the tone appropriate for opinion writing (beginning to shift to formal)?              | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | If the writing uses an informal or inappropriate tone, it does not meet the expectations for opinion writing.       | “I think cats are cool lol they are super chill.”                | The use of “lol” and “super chill” creates a highly informal tone, unsuitable for structured opinion writing.                                      |
|                                 |                                                                                        | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | The writing begins shifting toward a formal opinion-writing tone.                                                   | -                                                                | -                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Step 2: Formality Consistency Check** | Does the writing attempt a formal tone but maintain consistency?                               | No → Stop      | **Developing** | If the tone is inconsistent, the writing lacks polish and may confuse the audience.                                 | “Cats are better pets. They, um, like, don’t need much work.”    | The mix of informal fillers (“um, like”) disrupts an otherwise formal opinion statement.                                                           |
|                                 |                                                                                        | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | The writing maintains a formal style appropriate for opinion writing.                                               | “Cats are independent pets that require less maintenance than dogs.” | The statement is concise and retains a consistently formal tone without informal fillers.                                                          |
