| **Step 1: Objectivity Check**    | Does the writing maintain an objective and formal tone?                       | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | If the writing lacks an objective, formal style, it does not meet expert-level expectations.                                                                   | “I totally believe that students should get paid for good grades.”                                                        | “Totally believe” introduces a subjective, informal tone rather than an objective statement, which undermines the expert-level standard.                                                      |
|                                  |                                                                               | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | The writing maintains a formal and objective tone, so move to the next step.                                                                                  | -                                                                                                                            | -                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Step 2: Discipline-Specific Style Check** | Does the writing align with discipline-specific norms (academic, professional, etc.)? | No → Stop      | **Developing** | If the writing is formal but lacks discipline-specific conventions, it is still developing.                                                                    | “Students getting paid could maybe help them work harder.”                                                                 | The language (“could maybe help”) lacks the precision and authority typically expected in a discipline-specific or academic context.                                                         |
|                                  |                                                                               | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | The writing effectively maintains a discipline-specific formal style.                                                                                         | “Monetary incentives for academic performance can increase student motivation, as studies have demonstrated.”                                                     | Demonstrates an objective, precise tone with discipline-specific language (“monetary incentives,” “academic performance”), aligning with expert-level argument writing norms.                |
