| **Step**                  | **Description**                                                       | **Flow**       | **Result**      | **Explanation**                                                                                                    | **Examples**                                       | **Justification**                                                                                                                                  |

| **Step 1: Clarity Check**   | Is the writing clear and easy to follow?                                | No → Stop      | **Beginning**   | If the writing lacks clarity or is difficult to follow, it cannot be effective for a general audience.             | “Dog fun play. I like.” (Confusing and unclear)    | The sentences are fragmented and unclear, making it difficult to grasp the intended message.                                                        |
|                           |                                                                       | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*    | The writing is clear, so move to the next step.                                                                    | -                                                  | -                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Step 2: Informal Clarity Check** | Does the writing use an informal tone while maintaining clarity?             | No → Stop      | **Developing**  | The writing is informal but has inconsistent clarity, making some parts harder to follow.                          | “I like dogs because fun, but sometimes messy.”     | The statement is informal but the syntax is off, causing partial confusion and reducing clarity.                                                   |
|                           |                                                                       | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient**  | The writing is informal but clear, making it appropriate for a general audience.                                   | “Dogs are fun to play with. They make great pets.” | The informal style is acceptable at this level and remains clear enough for the reader to easily understand.                                        |
