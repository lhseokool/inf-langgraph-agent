| **Step 1: Presence Check**    | Is there a concluding statement?                          | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | The conclusion is missing or does not address the opinion, leaving the piece incomplete.                                     | **Opinion**: "I think recess is the best part of school."<br/>**Closing Statement**: *(None)*                          | Without any conclusion, the writing feels abrupt and unfinished.                                                                     |
|                            |                                                         | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | A concluding statement is present, so move to the next step.                                                                 | -                                                                                                                      | -                                                                                                                                      |
| **Step 2: Connection Check** | Does the conclusion connect to the opinion?               | No → Stop      | **Developing** | The conclusion is present but lacks clarity or connection to the opinion.                                                    | **Opinion**: "I think recess is the best part of school."<br/>**Closing Statement**: "Recess is okay."                 | While it mentions recess, it does not restate or clearly tie back to the main opinion (recess is the best part of school).            |
|                            |                                                         | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | The conclusion clearly connects to the opinion and signals the end of the writing.                                           | **Opinion**: "I think recess is the best part of school."<br/>**Closing Statement**: "That’s why I think recess is so important for kids." | The conclusion reiterates the opinion and clarifies its significance, providing a cohesive ending.                                    |
