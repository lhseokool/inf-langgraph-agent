| **Step**                   | **Description**                                            | **Flow**       | **Result**     | **Explanation**                                                                                                                   | **Examples**                                                                                                             | **Justification**                                                                                                                                     |

| **Step 1: Presence Check**    | Is there a concluding section?                              | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | The conclusion is incomplete, weak, or missing, leaving the argument unresolved.                                                 | **Claim**: "Recess is essential for students."<br/>**Closing Section**: *(None)*                                         | Without a conclusion, the argument remains open-ended and lacks a sense of resolution.                                                                |
|                            |                                                            | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | A concluding section is present, so move to the next step.                                                                       | -                                                                                                                        | -                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Step 2: Logical Support Check** | Does the conclusion logically follow and support the argument? | No → Stop      | **Developing** | The conclusion is weak or lacks logical support for the argument.                                                                | **Claim**: "Recess is essential for students."<br/>**Closing Section**: "Recess is nice for kids."                        | This brief statement fails to connect back to or reinforce the claim about recess being essential.                                                   |
|                            |                                                            | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | The conclusion logically follows and supports the argument.                                                                      | **Claim**: "Recess is essential for students."<br/>**Closing Section**: "Recess helps students recharge and return to class ready to learn, which makes it an essential part of the school day." | The conclusion reiterates how recess benefits students (recharging), linking directly to the original claim, thus providing coherence.                |
