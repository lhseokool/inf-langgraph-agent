| **Step 1: Presence Check**      | Is there a concluding section?                                        | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | The conclusion is vague, unrelated, or missing, leaving the argument unresolved.                                                                             | **Claim**: "Recess is vital for high school students."<br/>**Closing Section**: *(None)*                                                                               | With no conclusion, the argument does not offer any final insight or closure.                                                                                                |
|                                 |                                                                       | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | A concluding section is present, so move to the next step.                                                                                                   | -                                                                                                                                                                       | -                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Step 2: Depth Check**         | Does the conclusion provide a reflective or nuanced statement?        | No → Stop      | **Developing** | The conclusion is present but lacks depth or fails to connect to broader implications.                                                                        | **Claim**: "Recess is vital for high school students."<br/>**Closing Section**: "Recess is good for focus."                                                            | This conclusion is too simplistic for advanced writing, offering no reflection on the broader significance or deeper implications.                                          |
|                                 |                                                                       | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | The conclusion reflects on broader implications and ties back to the argument logically.                                                                     | **Claim**: "Recess is vital for high school students."<br/>**Closing Section**: "Recess is more than just a break; it is a fundamental tool for reducing stress and improving academic performance, which makes it a vital part of education." | This final statement does more than restate the claim: it adds depth by emphasizing stress reduction and academic benefits, underscoring the broader importance of recess. |
