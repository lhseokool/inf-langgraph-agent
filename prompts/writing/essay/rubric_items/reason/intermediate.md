| **Step 1: Presence Check** | Does the writing provide a reason to support the opinion?        | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | The reason is missing or irrelevant, leaving the opinion unsupported.                                                                       | **Opinion**: “I think recess is the best part of school.”<br/>**Reason**: “My friends are cool.”                                             | The reason “My friends are cool” does not clarify how that idea supports the opinion that recess is the best part of school.               |
|                         |                                                                | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | A reason is provided, so move to the next step.                                                                                             | -                                                                                                                                             | -                                                                                                                                           |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check** | Is the reason clear and understandable?                          | No → Stop      | **Developing** | The reason is present but vague or unclear, making it difficult to understand its connection to the opinion.                                | **Opinion**: “I think recess is the best part of school.”<br/>**Reason**: “It’s fun.”                                                         | The reason is relevant but lacks detail or explanation, offering weak support for the opinion.                                             |
|                         |                                                                | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | The reason is clear, detailed, and directly supports the opinion.                                                                           | **Opinion**: “I think recess is the best part of school.”<br/>**Reason**: “Recess helps us relax after studying and gives us time to play with our friends.” | The reason clearly explains why recess is the best part of school (relaxation, social play), meeting Grade 3-5 expectations for clarity.   |
