| **Step 1: Presence Check**        | Does the writing provide reasoning to support the claim? | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | Reasoning is missing, irrelevant, or fails to support the claim.                                                                                    | **Claim**: "Recess is vital for high school students."<br/>**Reason**: "It’s fun."                                                                              | The reasoning is overly simplistic, not addressing *why* recess is vital, especially for high school students.                                                      |
|                                   |                                                        | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | Reasoning is present, so move to the next step.                                                                                                     | -                                                                                                                                                               | -                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check**         | Is the reasoning logical and relevant to the claim?     | No → Stop      | **Developing** | Reasoning is present but lacks sophistication, depth, or logical focus.                                                                             | **Claim**: "Recess is vital for high school students."<br/>**Reason**: "It gives students time to rest."                                                       | Though relevant, it lacks a deeper explanation—*why* rest matters or how it impacts academic or personal outcomes—to meet higher-level sophistication.             |
|                                   |                                                        | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | The reasoning is nuanced, logical, and clearly supports the claim.                                                                                  | **Claim**: "Recess is vital for high school students."<br/>**Reason**: "Recess helps students recharge and concentrate better in class."                      | This offers a direct cause-and-effect link (recharge → better concentration) that aligns with the claim of recess being *vital* for older students.                |
