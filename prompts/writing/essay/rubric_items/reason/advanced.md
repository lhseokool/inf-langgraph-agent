| **Step 1: Presence Check**    | Does the writing provide reasoning to support the claim?       | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | Reasoning is missing, irrelevant, or unrelated to the claim.                                                                                 | **Claim**: “Recess is essential for students.”<br/>**Reason**: “It’s a time to eat snacks.”                                                 | The reason does not logically or meaningfully support why recess is essential, focusing instead on a minor or irrelevant aspect (snacking).                |
|                           |                                                                | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | Reasoning is present, so move to the next step.                                                                                              | -                                                                                                                                             | -                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check** | Is the reasoning logical and relevant to the claim?            | No → Stop      | **Developing** | Reasoning is present but lacks clarity, focus, or logical relevance.                                                                          | **Claim**: “Recess is essential for students.”<br/>**Reason**: “It helps kids do many things outside.”                                      | The statement is vague (“many things”) and does not pinpoint why or how these activities are essential to student well-being or academic success.          |
|                           |                                                                | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | The reasoning is clear, relevant, and directly supports the claim.                                                                           | **Claim**: “Recess is essential for students.”<br/>**Reason**: “Recess allows students to recharge their energy, improving focus in class.” | The explanation highlights a direct benefit (energy/focus), making it relevant and logically supporting the claim that recess is essential.                |
