| **Step**                | **Description**                                               | **Flow**       | **Result**     | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                         | **Examples**                                                                                                                                                 | **Justification**                                                                                                                            |

| **Step 1: Presence Check** | Does the writing provide a reason to support the opinion?     | No → Stop      | **Beginning**  | The reason is missing or irrelevant, leaving the opinion unsupported.                                                                                  | **Opinion**: “I like recess.”<br/>**Reason**: “Pizza is my favorite food.”                                                                                  | The stated reason has no logical connection to the opinion about recess, thus failing to support it.                                         |
|                         |                                                               | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*   | A reason is provided, so move to the next step.                                                                                                        | -                                                                                                                                                            | -                                                                                                                                             |
| **Step 2: Clarity Check** | Is the reason clear and understandable?                         | No → Stop      | **Developing** | The reason is present but vague or unclear, making it difficult to connect it to the opinion.                                                           | **Opinion**: “I like recess.”<br/>**Reason**: “It is fun for kids.”                                                                                        | While relevant to recess (fun for kids), the reason is too vague to provide strong support for the opinion.                                  |
|                         |                                                               | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient** | The reason is clear, age-appropriate, and directly supports the opinion.                                                                               | **Opinion**: “I like recess.”<br/>**Reason**: “Kids can play games with their friends.”                                                                    | The reason directly supports why the writer likes recess (playing with friends), which is sufficiently clear for Grades 1-2.                 |
