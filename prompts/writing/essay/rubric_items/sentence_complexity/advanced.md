| **Step**                             | **Description**                                                                        | **Flow**       | **Result**      | **Explanation**                                                                                                           | **Examples**                                                      | **Justification**                                                                                                                                    |

| **Step 1: Completion Check**        | Are all sentences complete (no fragments or run-ons)?                                  | No → Stop      | **Beginning**   | The sentences are incomplete, disorganized, or run-ons, making the writing unclear.                                          | “She study hard for test. Because she want better grade.”          | The second part is a fragment (“Because she want better grade”) rather than a complete sentence, causing confusion.                                 |
|                                     |                                                                                        | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*    | The sentences are complete, so move to the next step.                                                                        | -                                                                 | -                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Step 2: Complex Sentences Check** | Does the writing include complex and compound-complex sentences with appropriate conjunctions and clauses? | No → Stop      | **Developing**  | The writing struggles with creating or varying complex sentences, impacting clarity and depth.                               | “It was raining, and we went outside.”                             | While grammatically correct, it lacks the complexity expected at this level (e.g., subordinate clauses like “Although it was raining...” or “...because we enjoy the rain”). |
|                                     |                                                                                        | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient**  | The writing produces complex and compound-complex sentences effectively for the Advanced level.                              | “Although it was raining, we went outside **because** we were prepared.” | Demonstrates multiple subordinating conjunctions (although, because) to form a compound-complex sentence, fitting the advanced standard.             |
