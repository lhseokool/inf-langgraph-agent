| **Step**                           | **Description**                                                                              | **Flow**       | **Result**     | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                            | **Examples**                                                                                                            | **Justification**                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Step 1: Completion Check**      | Are all sentences complete (no fragments or run-ons)?                                        | No → Stop      | **Beginning** | The sentences are incomplete, disorganized, or run-ons, making the writing unclear.                                                                        | “Her argument clear but no evidence provided.”                                                                          | “Her argument clear” is incomplete (missing a verb or proper structure), reducing the clarity of the overall statement.                                              |
|                                   |                                                                                              | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*  | The sentences are complete, so move to the next step.                                                                                                      | -                                                                                                                       | -                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Step 2: Advanced Structures Check** | Does the writing use advanced sentence structures (e.g., compound-complex) effectively to convey relationships among ideas? | No → Stop      | **Developing**| The writing includes advanced structures inconsistently or with errors, limiting effectiveness.                                                             | “The team worked hard, but they failed.”                                                                                | While this is a correct compound sentence, it lacks the sophistication or variety expected in expert-level writing.                                                  |
|                                   |                                                                                              | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient**| The writing demonstrates effective use of advanced sentence structures, enhancing clarity and style.                                                        | “Her argument, while meticulously crafted, lacked the evidence necessary to persuade the audience.”                    | This sentence incorporates a subordinate clause (“while meticulously crafted”) and precise language to show complex relationships, fitting expert standards.           |
