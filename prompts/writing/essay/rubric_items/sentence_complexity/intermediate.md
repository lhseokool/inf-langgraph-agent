| **Step**                                | **Description**                                                                   | **Flow**       | **Result**      | **Explanation**                                                                                                   | **Examples**                                       | **Justification**                                                                                                                                    |

| **Step 1: Completion Check**           | Are all sentences complete (no fragments or run-ons)?                             | No → Stop      | **Beginning**   | The sentences are incomplete, disorganized, or run-ons, making the writing unclear.                                              | “I playing soccer. The park fun.”                  | “I playing soccer.” is incomplete; “The park fun.” lacks a verb, so the content is unclear.                                                           |
|                                         |                                                                                   | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*    | The sentences are complete, so move to the next step.                                                                           | -                                                  | -                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Step 2: Expanded Compound Sentences Check** | Does the writing include expanded compound sentences with appropriate conjunctions? | No → Stop      | **Developing**  | The writing produces sentences but struggles with clarity or variety in compound structures.                                     | “I like apples. I like oranges.”                   | Simple sentences with no conjunctions do not show progression in sentence variety.                                                                     |
|                                         |                                                                                   | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient**  | The writing uses expanded compound sentences effectively for the Intermediate level.                                             | “I like apples, **but** I prefer oranges **because** they are sweeter.” | Demonstrates the use of multiple conjunctions (but, because) to connect ideas into more complex sentence forms.                                          |
