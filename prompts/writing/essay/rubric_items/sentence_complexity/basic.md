| **Step**                       | **Description**                                                                | **Flow**       | **Result**      | **Explanation**                                                                                                     | **Examples**                                                      | **Justification**                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Step 1: Completion Check**   | Are all sentences complete (no fragments or run-ons)?                          | No → Stop      | **Beginning**   | The sentences are incomplete, disorganized, or run-ons, making the writing unclear.                                              | “The dog playing. The park fun.”                                  | The first is a fragment (“The dog playing”), and the second is incomplete (“The park fun”), preventing clarity and coherence.                                            |
|                                |                                                                                | Yes → Proceed  | *(continue)*    | The sentences are complete, so move to the next step.                                                                             | -                                                                 | -                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Step 2: Compound Sentences Check** | Does the writing include complete simple and compound sentences?                  | No → Stop      | **Developing**  | The writing includes simple sentences but lacks clarity or variety in compound sentences.                                         | “The dog is playing. The cat is sleeping.”                        | Both statements are correct but disconnected simple sentences, reducing overall sentence complexity.                                                                     |
|                                |                                                                                | Yes → Stop     | **Proficient**  | The writing produces complete simple and compound sentences appropriate for the Basic level.                                       | “The dog is playing, and the cat is sleeping.”                     | Combines two ideas using “and,” demonstrating a basic but correct use of compound sentence structure at the G1-2 level.                                                   |
